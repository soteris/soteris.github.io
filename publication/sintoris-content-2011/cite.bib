 abstract = {In this paper we discuss the use of social media as tools for collaboratively creating content for location-sensitive mobile educational games. One of the main challenges for the broader adoption of location-based mobile games for learning is the process of creating useful content. End-users, e.g. teachers and facilitators who use such games may be actively involved in this process. We discuss experience of using tools for end-user content creation for two location-sensitive mobile games. The game design process is presented as the interplay between technology, learning and content with the content generation as a distinct phase of the process. Finally we discuss the opportunities and limitations of using social media for content-creation.},
