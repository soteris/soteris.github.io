 abstract = {Data is being created at an increasing rate by sources like the IoT devices, social media, and camera monitors. This data frequently includes sensitive information that parties must redact to adhere to laws and user privacy policies. At the same time, there is steady progress on recognizers that Ô¨Ånd latent information within rich data streams, and thereby create fresh privacy risks. In this work, we advocate the idea of developing a modular, extensible toolkit based on decognizers which are information hiding functions derived from recognizers that redact sensitive information. We offer steps towards an abstract conceptual framework and compositional techniques and discuss requirements for such a toolkit.},
